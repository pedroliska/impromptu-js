- Quick demo of the new keyword and enumerations

- In POP
  - Show Jasmine tests. explain:
    - how resharper just runs them
    - how it injects the jasmine framework automatically
    - how it creates a website to host everything
    - how to keep the website running for debugging

  - Show how packages are organized in POP
    - look at the JS in Store Order cshtml
    - then show the package manager and template renderer
